# Day-Planner
The app should display standard business hours (9 a.m. to 5 p.m.). Each time slot should represent one hour and contain the following:


The time
A field to hold user input
A save button


Clicking on the save button will store the time and user input in localStorage.

Near the top of the calendar, the application should display the current day. Additionally, each hour should be color coded to reflect whether the time slot is in the past, the present, or the future. This will change depending on the time of day.
